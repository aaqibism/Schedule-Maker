# Schedule-Maker

Scheduling classes is a hassle especially when the school year is already underway.
While most students know which classes they want to take, it's often tiresome to manually
check back and forth whether class times will overlap or not. This website is aimed at
dealing this. Unfortunately, scheduling problems are NP-hard making this project WIP.

The back-end is a python server which uses a USC API to read in the data about each course
available at USC.
